# Capstone Project:

## 1. End-to-End Dockerized CI/CD Pipeline

Design and implement a complete deployment pipeline for containerized applications using Docker. The project emphasizes 

1. Security best practices
   
   1. Build time
   
   2. Supply chain
   
   3. Run time

2. Observability
   
   1. Basic monitoring stack
   
   2. Basic logging stack
   
   3. Simple ready to use dashboard 

3. It integrates CI/CD tools to ensure continuous integration and delivery. 

4. Participants will review real-world deployment issues, apply troubleshooting techniques, and build a functional pipeline from scratch in a hands-on lab environment.

## 2. Create a simple application like flask-message app (Docker compose)and make it scalable in docker swarm using docker playground.
